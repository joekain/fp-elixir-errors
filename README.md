Exercises from Chapter 4: Handling Errors Without Exceptions

This repo is part of my blog series on
[Learning Elixir](http://learningelixir.joekain.com/) in which
I work through exercises from _Functional Programming in Scala_ using Elixir.

These exercises have a companion post that describes some of the more
interesting exercises in detail: [Error Handling in Elixir](http://learningelixir.joekain.com/error-handling/)

If you'd like to work through the exercises yourself you can use my tests as
a guide.  To do this:

1. Clone the repo
2. Remove lib/handling_errors_without_exceptions.ex and replace it with an empty file.
3. Run `mix test`
4. Implement functions until the tests pass
